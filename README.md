# Next.js - Tailwind - MDX Remote Example Support Example

SOME Tailwind classes do not work in mdx if JIT is active in tailwind.config.js

This example of [/posts/example-post](http://localhost:3000/posts/example-post) shows Tailwind does not use all Tailwind classes in mdx if JIT is active in tailwind.config.js.
If JIT is inactive the Tailwind classes in mdx are used fine.

This repo is for support purpose to reproduce this issue.
